# My Dog Breed
Use AI tech to detect a dog breed from its image. A pet project.

Inspired from the [great learnings from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning), the goal is to experience in the creation of a web service for detecting dogs breeds from images using deep learning. My personal goal is to detect my own dog breed. All the activity will be tracked using issues.
